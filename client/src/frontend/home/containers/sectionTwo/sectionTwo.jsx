                You can set the time interval between stretches (20-55 minutes)
                and may snooze the timer to postpone the stretch to a more
                opportune time during the procedure.

              <p>
                This app will lead you through the stretch exercises (you don't
                have to remember them) and act as a timer to remind you when it
                is time to stretch. If engaging in any of these movements causes
                pain, you should stop immediately.
