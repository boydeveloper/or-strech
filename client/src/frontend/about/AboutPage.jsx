                The Intraoperative OR-Stretch helps alleviate any fatigue and
                discomfort associated with the surgeon and surgical team's
                postures assumed when performing surgery. A video guide to these
                stretches is available in a web app that includes a timer to
                remind the surgical team to perform these stretches at certain
                time intervals.

            <p>
              OR-Stretch is on a mission to alleviate the mental and physical
              stress surgeons face in the operating room. By incorporating
              simple stretches, our goal is to enhance performance, reduce pain,
              and improve mental focus without prolonging operative time. Recent
              studies show positive results, with attending surgeons
              experiencing reduced shoulder discomfort and minimal impact on
              workflow by incorporating microbreaks with OR-Stretch exercises.
              Surgeons express a keen interest in integrating these breaks into
              their routine, demonstrating OR-Stretch as an effective solution
              for mitigating work-related musculoskeletal fatigue and promoting
              surgeons' overall well-being.
